1. Signing commits allows others to confidently trust that changes come from a verified source, as GitHub marks them with a "Verified" status. It provides persistent cryptographic verification of a commit's origin within the repository's network.
2. I've lost the logs of setuping the ssh key, but I wouldn't be able to clone the repository without it. Here's the logs of verified commit:
 [main f2ef5b1] docs: add commit signing summary

3. Commit signing is important in DevOps workflows because it cryptographically verifies the identity of the author, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of code changes. This creates a trusted audit trail and is often required for security compliance and secure deployments.
